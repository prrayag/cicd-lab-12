# 1. Trigger this workflow on every push to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# 2. Define the jobs to run
jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and Test
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a Linux virtual machine

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Simulate a build step
      - name: Simulate Build
        run: echo "Building the website..."

      # Step 3: Run a simple test (check if 'Hello' is in the file)
      - name: Run a simple test
        run: |
          if grep -q "Hello" index.html; then
            echo "Test PASSED: 'Hello' string found."
          else
            echo "Test FAILED: 'Hello' string not found."
            exit 1
